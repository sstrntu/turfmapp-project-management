## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org), so changelogs could be generated automatically by that.

Additional rules:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 70 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- Each commit should be a single, stable change

### JavaScript

All JavaScript code should follow this [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). The pre-commit hook will help you find linting errors before committing.
